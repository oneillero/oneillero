- 👋 Hi, I’m @oneillero
- 👀 I’m interested in full-stack development, design, computer science, and computational neuroscience.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning full-stack development at MITxPRO and computational neuroscience with the University of Arizona. I am also learning Python through the iNeuron full-stack data science program.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects that will help deepen my understanding of programming but also allow me the ability to contribute for the benefit of the outcome.
- 📫 You can reach me via email at oneillero@gmail.com
